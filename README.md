Movie-RecSys-using-Surprise-Library.

The dataset used is the Movielens100K dataset. 

I have then splitted the dataset into training and validation sets. Then I have studied the test and the train sets and also created the utility matrix. 

Finally I have used many models from the 'Surprise' package like SVD ,kNN etc... .

I have compared the performance of all the models and then also tuned the parameters using the GridSearchCV.
